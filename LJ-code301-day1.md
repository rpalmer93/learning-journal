Journal Entry 1 1/9/2018:

Today started by pair programming with my assigned partner, we worked on an assignment where we had to make a specific page responsive, and if the page was expanded over a specific pixel width the mobile hamburger menu disappeared and the desktop view was shown. After morning lab was lecture where we discussed jQuery, MCV, and agile vs waterfall web development practices. (MVC: Model, View, Controller)
